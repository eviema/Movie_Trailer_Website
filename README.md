# Movie Trailer Website

This project builds a movie trailer website.

A list of my favorite movies are displayed on the static web page,
and you can click on the poster of a movie to watch its trailer.

Modules in this project:
* **fresh_tomatoes** deals with the front-end of the website, credit to adarsh0806.
* **media** defines class Movie at the back-end.
* **entertainment_centre** creates a list of Movie
objects, stores them in a list, and calls the open_movies_page
 function of fresh_tomatoes to generate an HTML web page at the back-end.

To test the code, run entertainment_centre.py at command line:
```
$ python entertainment_centre.py
```
